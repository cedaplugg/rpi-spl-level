## What is Sound Pressure Level

Sound level is usually defined in terms of something called Sound Pressure Level (SPL). SPL is actually a ratio of the absolute, Sound Pressure and a reference level (usually the Threshold of Hearing, or the lowest intensity sound that can be heard by most people). SPL is measured in decibels (dB), because of the incredibly broad range of intensities we can hear.
